```

> ### Problem 1

Define a path to the dataset:

``` r
path_p1 = "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx"
```

Read the Mr. Trashwheel dataset.

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
      read_xlsx(
        path = path_p1,
        sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
        range = cell_cols("A:N")
      ) %>% 
      janitor::clean_names() %>% 
      drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
      mutate(
        sports_ball = round(sports_balls),
        sports_ball = as.integer(sports_ball)
      )
```

Read precipitation data for 2018 and 2017:

``` r
precip_2018 = 
       read_excel(
              path = path_p1,
              sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
              skip = 1
              
       ) %>% 
       janitor::clean_names() %>% 
       drop_na(month) %>% 
       mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
       relocate(year)


precip_2017 = 
       read_excel(
              path = path_p1,
              sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
              skip = 1
       ) %>% 
       janitor::clean_names() %>% 
       drop_na(month) %>% 
       mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
       relocate(year)
```

Combine annual precipitation dataframe:

``` r
month_df = 
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )

precip_df = 
    bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017)

precip_df = 
    left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash
collector in Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the
trashwheel collects that trash, and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset
contains information on year, month, and trash collected, include some
specific kinds of trash. There are a total of 344 rows in our final
dataset. Additional data sheets include month precipitation data. In
this dataset:

  - The median number of sports balls found in a dumpster in 2017 was 8
  - The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches.

> ### Problem 2

Set the path of data:

``` r
path_p2 = "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv"
```

Read NYC\_Transit\_Subway\_Entrance\_And\_Exit\_Data data:

``` r
NYC_df = 
      read_csv(
             file = path_p2,
      ) %>% 
      janitor::clean_names() %>% 
      select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>% 
      mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE),
             vending = recode(vending, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE)
             
             )
```

The dataset has 20 variables and they are ada, entrance\_type, entry,
exit\_only, line, route1, route10, route11, route2, route3, route4,
route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, station\_latitude,
station\_longitude, station\_name, vending. I have dropped the variables
that I do not need and converted `entry` and `vending` from character to
logical variables. The dimension of the dataset is 1868 rows \* 20
columns. These data are not tidy enough since the route services have
not been converted. The dataset shows:

  - There are 465 distinct stations.
  - There are 84 stations are ADA compliant.
  - Proportion of station entrance/exit without vending allow entrance
    is 0.1569892.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
NYC_df_t = 
          NYC_df %>% 
  
  #First, I tried directly convert route1:route11 and failed since their value types are different. Then, I tried to divide route to route1:7(char) and route8:11(dbl) and pivot them separately, but when they finally left_join, the data always drop the characters in "train" which I can't figure the reason out. Hence, I change all of them to factor.
          
          mutate(route1 = factor(route1),   
                 route2 = factor(route2),
                 route3 = factor(route3),
                 route4 = factor(route4),
                 route5 = factor(route5),
                 route6 = factor(route6),
                 route7 = factor(route7),
                 route8 = factor(route8),
                 route9 = factor(route9),
                 route10 = factor(route10),
                 route11 = factor(route11)
                 ) %>% 
         pivot_longer(
               route1:route11,
               names_to = "route_number",
               names_prefix = "route",
               values_to = "train"
         ) %>% 
         arrange(route_number)
```

There are 60 distinct stations serve the A train, and for the stations
serve the A train, there are 17 that is ADA compliant.

> ### Problem 3

First, we tidy the pols\_month.csv:

``` r
pols_month_df = 
          read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>% 
          janitor::clean_names() %>% 
          separate(mon, c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "([-])") %>% 
          mutate(month = as.numeric(month),
                 day = as.numeric(day),
                 year = as.numeric(year),
                 data = year * 100 + month
                 ) %>% 
          relocate(prez_gop, prez_dem) %>% 
          pivot_longer(
                 prez_gop:prez_dem,
                 names_to = "president",
                 names_prefix = "prez_",
                 values_to = "justify"
          ) %>% 
          filter(justify == 1) %>% 
          select(-day, -justify) %>% 
          relocate(data)
          
month_df = 
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )

pols_month_df = 
         left_join(pols_month_df, month_df, by = "month") %>% 
         relocate(data, year, month_name) %>% 
         select(-month) %>% 
         rename(month = month_name)
```

Then, we tidy the snp.csv:

``` r
snp_df = 
          read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>% 
          janitor::clean_names() %>% 
          separate(date, c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "([/])") %>% 
          mutate(month = as.numeric(month),
                 day = as.numeric(day),
                 year = as.numeric(year)
                 )  

snp_df = 
          left_join(snp_df, month_df, by = "month") %>% 
          mutate(data = year * 100 + month) %>% 
          relocate(data, year, month_name) %>%
          select(-month, -day) %>% 
          rename(month = month_name)
```

After that, we tidy the unemployment.csv:

``` r
unemployment_df = 
              read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>% 
              janitor::clean_names() %>% 
              pivot_longer(
                jan:dec,
                names_to = "month",
                values_to = "percentage_unemployment"
              ) %>% 
              mutate(month = recode(month, "jan" = "January", "feb" = "February", "mar" = "March", "apr" = "April", "may" = "May", "jun" = "June", "jul" = "July", "aug" = "August", "sep" = "September", "oct" = "October", "nov" = "November", "dec" = "December"))


month_df_1 = 
  tibble(
    month_number = 1:12,
    month = month.name
  )


unemployment_df =
              left_join(unemployment_df, month_df_1, by = "month") %>% 
              mutate(data = year * 100 + month_number) %>% 
              select(-month_number) %>% 
              relocate(data)
```

Finally, we combine them together and get the result (use `data` as key
variable):

``` r
result_df = 
        left_join(pols_month_df, snp_df, by = "data") %>% 
        left_join(., unemployment_df, by = "data") %>% 
        select(-year.y, -month.y, -year, -month) %>% 
        rename(year = year.x, month = month.x) %>% 
        arrange(data) %>% 
        select(-data)
```

***Summary***

  - `pols_month_df` contains information on the years and months of the
    count, the number of all kinds of republican (governors, senators,
    and representatives) on the associate date, the number of all kinds
    of democratic (governors, senators, and representatives) on the
    associate date, and which partisan the president is from.

  - `snp_df` contains information on the years and months related to
    Standard & Poor’s stock market index (S\&P), and the closing values
    of the S\&P stock index on the associated date.

  - `unemployment_df` contains the information on the years and months
    of the measurements, and the percentage of unemployment related to
    the year and the month.

As for the `result_df`, the names of the key variables are close,
gov\_dem, gov\_gop, month, percentage\_unemployment, president,
rep\_dem, rep\_gop, sen\_dem, sen\_gop, year; The dimension of if is 817
rows \* 11 columns; The range of years is (1947, 2015). It shows the
combination of situation of president partisan, the closing values of
the S\&P stock index, and the percentage of employment on the associated
date, which could help us analyze the relationship between them\!
